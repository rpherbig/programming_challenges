Programming Challenge: Palindrome

Copied from the Greplin Challenge (problem 1): http://challenge.greplin.com/

Using this http://challenge.greplin.com/static/gettysburg.txt as a source, write a program to find the longest substring that is also the same when reversed.

Example:
"I like racecars that go fast"
The answer would be "racecar".
