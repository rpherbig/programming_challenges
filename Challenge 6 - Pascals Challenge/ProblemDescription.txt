Programming Challenge: Pascal's Challenge

Write a program to compute the value of a given position in Pascal's Triangle.

P(row, position) => value

 	 	 	 	1	 	 	 	 
 	 	 	1	 	1	 	 	 
 	 	1	 	2	 	1	 	 
 	1	 	3	 	3	 	1	 
1	 	4	 	6	 	4	 	1
 

A few examples:

P(0,0) => 1
P(1,1) => 1
P(2, 1) => 2
P(4, 2) => 6
