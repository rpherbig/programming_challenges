What are these programming challenges?
======================

Short problems that are still interesting.

They should require no specialized knowledge to solve and have no "gotchas".

How do I solve them?
======================

Solve the problem with code. Use any language.

Solve the problem the way you would prefer to solve the problem (i.e. use your style).

Share your solutions with others to learn and grow (if you send me your solution, I'll add it).

If you enjoy these sorts of things, please send me your suggestions for new challenges.

Why do this?
======================

Everyone solves problems differently. We all have neat little programming tricks/styles/etc that we use on a daily basis, but that nobody else gets to see.

And because it's fun.
