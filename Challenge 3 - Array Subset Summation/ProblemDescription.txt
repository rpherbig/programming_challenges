Programming Challenge: Array Subset Summation

Copied from the Greplin Challenge (problem 3): http://challenge.greplin.com/

Find all subsets of an array where the largest number is the sum of the remaining numbers.

For example, for an input of:
(1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
the subsets would be
1 + 2 = 3
1 + 3 = 4
2 + 4 = 6
1 + 2 + 3 = 6
and the answer would be 4.

Here is the list of numbers you should run your code on:
(3, 4, 9, 14, 15, 19, 28, 37, 47, 50, 54, 56, 59, 61, 70, 73, 78, 81, 92, 95, 97, 99)
